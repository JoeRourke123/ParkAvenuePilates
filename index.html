                        <p>I’ve always been interested in the health and wellbeing sector having trained as an aerobics
                            instructor in my 20s and working freelance for Champneys, Tring. Due to family commitments I
                            took up a career in education to be able to work flexibly whilst my children were growing up
                            but there has always been a desire to return to the industry in some format. Although I came
                            away from the sector I continued my own fitness journey taking up running and yoga, along
                            with numerous other classes like HIIT and spinning but unfortunately I was plagued with
                            injury specifically chronic low back pain. This is how I discovered Pilates and the
                            lightbulb moment occurred. It was a revelation to me to be able to continue with some form
                            of exercise during the rehabilitative stages of injury recovery. Training to become a
                            qualified Matwork Pilates instructor with the APPI has enabled me to explore this technique
                            in detail and the benefits it has not only to the body but to the mind as well.

                                    Her small group classes are varied and engaging and her teaching technique is clear and informative.

                                    Whether you are a newcomer to pilates or have previous experience I would highly recommend Park Avenue Pilates. The zoom classes during lockdown have been a godsend!</p>

                                    is a great teacher: encouraging, non-judgemental and skilled. I texted her before

                                    and she dropped an entire personalised programme through my door! Can't recommend

                                    interested. She will do a 1:1 to understand your needs and the classes are small so
                                    she can focus on specific areas and make sure you are doing the exercise correctly.
                                     Everyone of all ages and abilities can enjoy the classes which are well planned and
